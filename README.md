# Text Summarization Techniques
Text summarization is a process of shortening text documents into a summary. There are two types of automatic summarization techniques are available, those are Extractive summarization and Abstractive summarization.

In this repository I use Extractive summarization techniques to summarize the data. This extractive summarizer extracts significant sentences from the original text to make a summary. There are five types available,
 - LexRank Summarizer
 - LSA Summarizer
 - Luhn Summarizer
 - KL Summarizer
 - TextRank Summarizer
